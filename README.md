# PythonDiscBot
A python bot to allow flag racers to upload their scores and allow guild admins to edit the scores.  Has automatic saving, along with weekly calculations and a backup of all racing data.
Intended to be hosted on a cloud service (I used google cloud free compute engine https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-tier-usage-limits, can be done with any cloud service such as AWS ec2, or hell your own computer if you wanna keep it on).
